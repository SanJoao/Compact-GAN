# Compact-RL
Compact GAN is a simplified, parameter-efficient generative adversarial network architecture that leverages shared biases and reversible operations. Designed without convolutions to evaluate raw accuracy, it achieves 73% accuracy in generated image recognition and offers potential for adaptation to multimodal inputs.
